Build a vector DB of case issues and resolutions for 2 years’ worth of Pan-HPE SFDC case data.  
Update the vector DB in the form of FAISS (Facebook AI similarity search) usable directly inside Cognate AI 
Build a pipeline to update the vector DB in a scheduled cadence 
Test similar case and resolution search using the implemented Vector DB and align the accuracy with GSR 
Scope should also include CFIs and other sources as currently searched by Engineers – guidance needed from Guru and Satish 
Inclusions :
2 years of case data, CFIs (GSR to give more info), any other sources currently used by engineers (GSR to give more info)
Fields should include all text fields of case data like issue / subject / resolution / notes. (GSR to confirm).
Exclusions :
KM articles which are already in Coveo
Milestones :
Finalization of fields to be vectorized with GSR/ DE : AC – GSR sign off on the fields
Initial Vectorization and saving as FAISS file : AC – showcase that any randomly selected case details are vectorized
Creation of test data along with GSR / DE : AC – GSR sign of on the test data
Accuracy measurement using provided test set of data and iteration on vectorization alongside : AC – GSR sign off on the accepted accuracy level
Update of the vector db in Cognate AI – keeping current functionalities intact : AC – addition of unit and fitness / regression tests, with build success
Creation of a pipeline to do the vectorization on a scheduled manner : AC – 1) SRE, Security signoff, 2) Demo update of vectorDB 3) Schedule done as per GSR advice
New Jenkins job might be needed
SMART involvement to be aligned
NFRs to be met – including monitoring, alerting, supportability
Security aspects to be aligned
Deployed to ITG/PRO : AC – KM Generation Agent is able to call updated vectorDB with replacement of API2 : Coveo case lexical search
